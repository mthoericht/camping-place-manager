# Project Context: AGENTS.md

This workspace follows the conventions and workflows described in **AGENTS.md** (project root).

Before changing architecture, structure, or workflows:

1. **Read AGENTS.md** – it contains project overview, commands (dev, build, Prisma, tests), architecture (frontend/backend), file organization, code style, and the "Adding a New Entity" checklist.
2. **Follow the conventions** – e.g. Redux slices with EntityAdapter, routing in App.tsx, German UI text, delete protection for places/items when active bookings exist.

When unsure about structure or conventions, check AGENTS.md first.
